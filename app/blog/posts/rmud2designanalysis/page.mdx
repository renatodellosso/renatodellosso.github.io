# A Game Design Analysis of RMUD2

11/2/2024

People (well, a person, maybe two on a good day) sometimes ask me about RMUD2 (Renato's Multi-User Dungeon 2), a text-based MMO
I made a while ago. Their questions are often along the lines of "Can you bring the server back up?" so I'm dodging that question and
instead investigating what kind of game RMUD2 is.

I mostly just winged the design of RMUD2, so I'm not going to delve into why I made the choices I did because I frankly
don't know.

With that summary out of the way, let's jump in and see if I came up with any insightful commentary today. Spoiler: probably not.

## What kind of game is RMUD2?

Well, for starters, it's a text-based MMO. The game is displayed through text and player click buttons to control their character.
There is/was a single server with all players inhabiting the same instance. So far, pretty simple: RMUD2 is a single-shard text-based
MMO.

It's also at least notionally an RPG. Players kill monsters to earn XP, which increases their level, thus letting them increase their ability
scores. However, that's basically it. There aren't classes, skills, or other trappings of a full RPG. It definitely does not have the same
feel as a CRPG like Pillars of Eternity or the original Baldur's Gate games; the RPG elements are closer to a watered-down Skyrim (itself a
watered-down version of full RPGs). Thus, we can add RPG-lite to list of descriptors: a single-shard text-based MMORPG-lite.

Now that we've covered what you *don't* do in RMUD2, let's talk about what you do do. You enter the dungeon. Once in the dungeon, you explore
rooms and fight monsters. Not so different from one of the aforementioned CRPGs. However, once you finish your monster-homicide, things start
to diverge meaningfully. If you've ever played a CRPG, you'll remember all the random items you got from monsters. "Kobold Claws," "Bandit 
Meat," and "Assorted Not-Precious Gems." You'll usually be able to craft with these items, through a submenu inside a dropdown hidden away 
in a tab on the secondary inventory screen's bottom left corner, but you'll never actually craft anything. Why would you? There's no special
items to be gotten from crafting and the game's balance seems fine without crafting. Crafting might as well not exist in these
games.

RMUD2 is *not* those games. You can buy gear from the low-single-digit number of shopkeepers, but it peaks somewhere around "Rusty Stick."
The real gear is in the crafting station next to the shopkeeper. In other games, you got to the Michelin-starred restaurant that is the local
blacksmith, but in RMUD2, you go to the local McDonald's, walk past the confused employees, and cook a filet mignon on their grill. Basically,
the blacksmith is useless, but their anvil sure isn't: the anvil is where you craft the gear that gets you into mid-game. The rest of RMUD2
is similar, just with higher-tier crafting stations and 12-step recipes requiring three eyeballs from a hell-orc's half-uncle.

Now that you've gotten your orc eyeballs, you need to get back to town where you can use them to craft a new breastplate. Two threats
may object to your return: the dungeon's monsters and other players. Players are fully able to attack each other, except in the town.
So RMUD2 has elements of an extraction shooter (minus the shooting). However, death does not result in you actually dropping your inventory,
so it's much calmer than most extraction shooters.

We've now covered all the major elements of RMUD2's gameplay. So what do we have? RMUD2 is a PvPvE single-shard text-based MMORPG-lite 
focused around simple combat and crafting and is fairly casual. I suspect that casualness helped get some of my friends to play it, as 
it doesn't have too many elements of any particular genre.
